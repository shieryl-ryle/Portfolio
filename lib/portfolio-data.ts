    "I'm a data engineer and software developer powered by curiosity, creativity, and a love for solving real problems. I enjoy turning raw, messy data into clean, reliable, and meaningful systems that help people understand what’s really happening behind the scenes.",
    "My journey in tech started inside the four walls of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, where I discovered not just how to build software, but how data can shape stories, decisions, and entire products. Since then, I've built end-to-end data pipelines, scalable models, and analytical solutions supporting thousands to hundreds of millions of records—always with clarity, reliability, and impact in mind.",
    "FUN FACT: If I'm not deep in SQL or Python, I'm probably in a quiet café, discovering new coffee, or getting lost in the mountains"
